    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p1>Delicious chocolate chip pancakes, they are exactly as described. Chocolatey, chippy and pancakey. Best served with a cup of tea and maple syrup.</p1>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>3/4 cup of milk</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons white vinegar</li>
        <li>1 cup all purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon of baking powder</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon of salt</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons of unsalted butter, melted</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1/2 cup of chocolate chips, or more to taste</li>
        <li>Cooking spray</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine milk and vinegar in a bowl and set aside for 5 minutes to "sour" the milk. You are essentially making your own buttermilk with this step.</li>
        <li>Combine flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large mixing bowl.</li>
        <li>Whisk egg, butter, and vanilla extract into "soured" milk until well combined. Pour flour mixture into the wet ingredients and whisk until just combined. Fold in chocolate chips. Batter will be thick. Allow batter to rest for 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Heat a large skillet over medium-low heat, and coat with cooking spray.</li>
        <li>Pour about Â¼ cup of batter for each pancake onto the skillet. Cook until bubbles appear on the surface, 2 to 4 minutes. Flip pancake with a spatula, and cook until browned on the other side, 2 to 3 more minutes. Repeat with remaining batter. Serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
