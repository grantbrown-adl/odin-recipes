    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p1>Eggs in bread with wilted spinach and hollandaise I hear you ask? Yes, it is as delicious as it sounds.</p1>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>4 slices bread (rustic or sourdough)</li>
        <li>60g unsalted butter</li>
        <li>4 eggs</li>
        <li>Hollandaise sauce (see note), to serve</li>          
        <li>Wilted spinach, to serve</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
       <li> Preheat the oven to 200Â°C. Use an 8cm round cutter to cut a hole in the centre of each bread slice.</li>
       <li>Melt butter in a large ovenproof frypan over medium heat. 
           In batches if necessary, cook bread on one side for 1-2 minutes until golden, then turn the bread over. 
           Transfer all bread, toasted-side down, back to the pan (or a lined baking tray), then carefully crack an egg into each hole. 
           Season, then bake for 3-4 minutes until eggs are just set.</li>
       <li>Transfer to plates with a fish slice, then serve with spinach and hollandaise sauce.</li>
    </ol>
